Turns out, there are a ton of instant ramen noodle recipes that you can make with a simple package of dried noodles, perfect for an easy weeknight meal or healthy lunch idea (especially if you pack some extra veggies into the broth!). Open the wrapper, toss the seasoning packets and give one of these crazy-delicious ramen recipes a try. You can pair your noodles with everything from eggs and chicken to mushrooms and tofu, which means you can try these "pulled noodles" a bunch of different ways! Of course, traditional ramen is served as a soup with broth, but you can also use the noodles to create a delicious salad.
